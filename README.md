# CostClock

**See what your time actually costs.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Professionals have **zero visibility** on how their time is actually spent and what it costs (financially AND cognitively). Meetings happen without accountability, deep work gets fragmented, and nobody measures the real impact.

## 💡 The Solution

CostClock is a smart productivity timer that:
- **Tracks your work sessions** (Focus, Deep Work, Meetings, Breaks)
- **Calculates meeting costs in real-time** (direct + opportunity cost)
- **Provides behavioral analytics** (when are you actually productive?)
- **Works offline-first** (your data never leaves your device)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** + **Vite** + **TypeScript**
- **Pinia** (State Management)
- **Dexie.js** (IndexedDB / Local Storage)
- **Chart.js** (Analytics Visualization)
- **PWA** (Workbox - Offline Support)
- **Vercel** (Deployment)
