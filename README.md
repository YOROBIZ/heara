# Heara

**Hear what truly matters.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Professionals lose track of how their time is actually spent. Conversations drift, focus fragments, and the cost—financial and cognitive—remains invisible.

## 💡 The Solution

Heara is a calm productivity companion that:
- **Observes your work sessions** (Focus, Deep Focus, Conversation, Pause)
- **Reveals conversation costs in real-time** (direct + opportunity cost)
- **Understands your rhythm** (when you're most focused, when to pause)
- **Protects your privacy** (your data never leaves your device)

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Vue 3** + **Vite** + **TypeScript**
- **Pinia** (State Management)
- **Dexie.js** (IndexedDB / Local Storage)
- **Chart.js** (Analytics Visualization)
- **PWA** (Workbox - Offline Support)
- **Vercel** (Deployment)
